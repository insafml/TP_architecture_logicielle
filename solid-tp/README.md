## SOLID:
 # Single Responsibility Principle: 
The idea behind the SRP is that every class, module, or function in a program should have one responsibility/purpose in a program. As a commonly used definition, "every class should have only one reason to change".
 # Open/Closed Principle:
 This means that a class should be extendable without modifying the class itself.
 # Liskov Substitution Principle:
 This means that every subclass or derived class should be substitutable for their base or parent class.
 # Interface Segregation Principle:
 The interface segregation principle states that a client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn’t use, or clients shouldn’t be forced to depend on methods they do not use.
 # Dependency Inversion Principle:
 Dependency inversion principle states that entities must depend on abstractions, not on concretions. It states that the high-level module must not depend on the low-level module, but they should depend on abstractions.
